Question:
How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile.
If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace in seconds per mile?
What is your average pace in minutes and seconds per mile?
What is your average speed in miles per hour?

Code:
minutes = 42
seconds = 42
km = 10
km_to_mile = 1.61

# Convert 42 minutes 42 seconds to total seconds
total_seconds =  minutes * 60 + seconds

# Convert 10 kilometers to miles
total_miles = km / km_to_mile

# Calculate average pace in seconds per mile
avg_pace_spm = total_seconds / total_miles

# Calculate average pace in minutes and seconds per mile
avg_pace_minutes = avg_pace_spm // 60
avg_pace_seconds = avg_pace_spm % 60

# Calculate average speed in miles per hour
avg_speed_mph = total_miles / (total_seconds / 3600)

print("Total seconds:", total_seconds)
print("Miles:", total_miles)
print("Average pace in seconds per mile:", avg_pace_spm)
print("Average pace in minutes and seconds per mile:", avg_pace_minutes, avg_pace_seconds)
print("Average speed in miles per hour:", avg_speed_mph)

Output:
Total seconds: 2562
Miles: 6.211180124223602
Average pace in seconds per mile: 412.482
Average pace in minutes and seconds per mile: 6.0 52.48200000000003
Average speed in miles per hour: 8.727653570337614
