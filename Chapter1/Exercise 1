Question:
You might wonder what round does if a number ends in 0.5. The answer is that it sometimes rounds
up and sometimes rounds down. Why?

Answer:
In python bankers rounding is followed, to reduce bias in calculations, by not always
rounding off to either ceiling value or floor value. Itâ€™s always rounded off to the nearest even value.  
Ex:
round(42.5)- output 42
round(41.5)- output 42
